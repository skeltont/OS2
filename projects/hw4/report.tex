\begin{abstract}
In this assignment I will describe how I was able to implement best fit into the slob memory manager.
I will provide answer to several questions about my process and what I learned, along with logs for work and version control.
This report is accompanied by a patch file that reflects my changes.

\subsection{Main Point of Assignment}
The main point of this assignment I believe was to teach us about how memory managers work and to see a \textit{really bad one} in action.
I had a faint understanding of how pages were implemented and managed when I was doing the assigned readings, but after getting into the slob manager it really demystified a lot for me.
In reference to my ``really bad one" statement earlier, when using the slob manager I let it boot on it's own without any changes and it just never started.
So I therefore learned to not take for granted the things modern operating systems are able to pull off.

\subsection{Approach}
My approach for this assignment was the same as all of the others so far.
First I made to sure I was able to successfully get into the boot stage with the slob memory manager.
After that I started to make print statements to see what kind of data I was working with.
I talked to some other students and got a feel for some problem areas and then started to make meaningful changes.
Early on I had a lot of issues with getting it to actually work, but I figured out I didn't have a base case for allocating a page when there were none.
Fixing that meant I was done and it was exciting.

\subsection{Ensuring solution was correct}
To ensure the solution was correct I used plenty of print statements to tell me through the console when something became a best fit, was default, etc.

\subsection{What was learned}
I learned that modern operating systems are really well-tuned machines for having such good memory management systems.
The slob and my variation were both very slow and it seems tough to do this well.
I learned it wasn't as hard as I thought it was gonna be, but that doesn't mean much because it was still hard.
Overall I'd say (since this is the last write-up for the class) I learned a lot about kernel development as a whole and have found a higher appreciation for it.
I do not think I'll ever find myself in this field of work, but I can definitely say I've considered it now.
